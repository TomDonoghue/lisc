        "Complex Search Terms\n--------------------\n\nSo far, we have chosen some search terms, as single terms, to use as queries,\nand added them to our object.\n\nSometimes we might want more than just particular search words. We might want to\nspecify synonyms and/or use include inclusions or exclusion words.\n\nSynonyms\n~~~~~~~~\n\nTo include synonyms, just add more entries to the input list of terms.\n\nSynonyms are combined with the 'OR' operator, meaning results will\nbe returned if they include any of the given terms.\n\nFor example, the set of search terms ['brain', 'cortex'] is interpreted as:\n'(\"brain\"OR\"cortex\")'.\n\nBeing able to include synonyms is the reason each term entry is itself a list.\n\nInclusion & Exclusion Words\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSometimes we might need to control the results that we get, by including inclusion\nand exclusion words.\n\nInclusions words are words that must also appear in the document for a result\nto be returned. Inclusions words are combined with the 'AND' operator, meaning entries\nwill only be included if they also include these words.\n\nFor example, the search terms ['brain', 'cortex'] with the inclusion word ['biology']\nis interpreted as '(\"brain\"OR\"cortex\")AND(\"biology\")'.\n\nExclusions words are words that must not be included in a result in order for it\nto be returned. Exclusion words are combined with the 'NOT' operator, meaning entries\nwill be excluded if they include these terms.\n\nFor example, the search terms ['brain', 'cortex'] with the exclusion word ['body']\nis interpreted as '(\"brain\"OR\"cortex\")NOT(\"body\")'.\n\nPutting it all Together\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSynonyms, inclusion and exclusion words can all be used together.\nYou can also specify synonyms for inclusion and exclusion words.\n\nFor example, the following set of search term components:\n\n- search terms ['brain', 'cortex']\n- inclusion words ['biology', 'biochemistry']\n- exclusion words ['body', 'corporeal']\n\nAll combine to give the seach term of:\n\n- `'(\"gene\"OR\"genetic)AND(\"biology\"OR\"biochemistry\")NOT(\"body\"OR\"corporeal)'`\n\nInclusion and exclusion words should be lists of the same length as the\nnumber of search terms. Each inclusion and exclusion term is used for the\ncorresponding search term, matched by index. If there are no inclusions / exclusions\nfor a given search term, leave it empty with an empty list.\n\nNow let's update our set of terms, to include some synonyms, inclusions and exclusions.\n\n\n"
