Tutorial 04: Words Analysis
===========================

Analyzing collected text data and metadata.


Words Analyses
--------------

This tutorial covers exploring & analyzing words data.

For this tutorial, we will reload and use the `Words` data that we collected
in the last tutorial.




.. code-block:: python


    from lisc.data import Articles, ArticlesAll
    from lisc.utils.db import SCDB
    from lisc.utils.io import load_object

    from lisc.plts.words import plot_wordcloud







Articles Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LISC uses a custom objects to store and organize collected words data.

These objects are used internally in the `Words` objects.

If the data collection was set to save out data as it was collected, then 'Articles'
objects can be loaded individually, using the label of the search term.




.. code-block:: python


    # Set up database object
    db = SCDB('lisc_db')

    # Load raw data for a particular term
    term = 'frontal lobe'
    arts = Articles(term)
    arts.load(db)







ArticlesAll Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is also the `ArticlesAll` object, which is variant which can be used to
aggregate collected data across all articles collected for a given search term.

The ArticlesAll object also has methods to create and check summaries
created from the aggregate data, across all articles for a given search term.




.. code-block:: python


    # Collapse data across articles
    arts_all = ArticlesAll(arts)








.. code-block:: python


    # Check an example summary
    arts_all.create_summary()
    arts_all.print_summary()





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    frontal lobe :
      Number of articles:            15
      First publication:             2019
      Most common author:            Sahar F
        number of publications:      1
      Most common journal:           World neurosurgery
        number of publications:      2


Words Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Words` object can also be used to reload and analyze collected data.

The `results` attribute of the `Words` object, when loaded, contains a list of
Articles objects, one for each term.




.. code-block:: python


    # Reload the words object
    words = load_object('tutorial_words', directory=SCDB('lisc_db'))








.. code-block:: python


    # Reload all data
    for ind in range(words.n_terms):
        words.results[ind].load(directory=db)








.. code-block:: python


    # Collect into list of aggragated data objects
    all_articles = [ArticlesAll(words[label]) for label in words.labels]








.. code-block:: python


    # Plot a WordCloud of the collected data for the first term
    plot_wordcloud(all_articles[0].words, 25)

Exploring Words Data
--------------------

The Words object also has some methods for exploring the data.




.. code-block:: python


    # Indexing with labels
    print(words['frontal lobe'])





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    <lisc.data.articles.Articles object at 0x133a50a20>



.. code-block:: python


    # Iterating through articles found from a particular search term
    #  The iteration returns a dictionary with all the article data
    for art in words['temporal lobe']:
        print(art['title'])





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

Analyzing Words Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Further analysis is mostly determined by what one wants to do with the collected data.

Words data can be used to, for example, build profiles for search terms, based
on distributions of words in related articles. This could include methods from
natural language processing such as vector embeddings, measuring similarities and
differences between terms.

Other analyses could explore historical patterns in the literature exploring, for
exploring the history of when certain topics were written about, and in what
journals, by which authors.
