Tutorial 04: Words Analysis
===========================

Analyzing collected text data and metadata.


Words Analyses
--------------

This tutorial covers exploring & anayzing words data.

For this tutorial, we will reload and use the `Words` data that we collected
in the last tutorial.




.. code-block:: python


    from lisc import SCDB, load_object
    from lisc.data import Data, DataAll

    from lisc.plts.wordcloud import plot_wordcloud







Data Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~

LISC uses a custom object to store and organize collected words data.

These objects are used internally in the `Words` objects.

If th data collection was set to save out data as it was collected, then these Data
objects can be loaded individually, using the label of the search term.




.. code-block:: python


    # Set up database object
    db = SCDB('lisc_db')

    # Load raw data for a particular term
    term = 'frontal lobe'
    data = Data(term)
    data.load(db)







DataAll Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is also the `DataAll` object, which is variant which can be used to
aggregate collected data across all articles collected for a given search term.

The DataAll also have methods to create and check summaries created from the aggregate data.




.. code-block:: python


    # Collapse data across papers
    data_all = DataAll(data)








.. code-block:: python


    # Check an example summary
    data_all.create_summary()
    data_all.print_summary()





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    frontal lobe :
      Number of articles:            14
      First publication:             2019
      Most common author:            Y Zhang
        number of publications:      3
      Most common journal:           Physiotherapy theory and practice
        number of publications:      1


Words Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Words` object can also be used to reload and analyze collected data.

The `results` attribute of the `Words` object, when loaded, contains a list of
Data objects, one for each term.




.. code-block:: python


    # Reload the words object
    words = load_object('tutorial_words', folder=SCDB('lisc_db'))








.. code-block:: python


    # Reload all data
    for ind in range(words.n_terms):
        words.results[ind].load(folder=db)








.. code-block:: python


    # Collect into list of aggragated data objects
    all_dat = [DataAll(words[label]) for label in words.labels]








.. code-block:: python


    # Plot a WordCloud of the collected data for the first term
    plot_wordcloud(all_dat[0].words, 25)

Exploring Words Data
--------------------

The words object also has a couple convenience methods for exploring the data.




.. code-block:: python


    # Indexing with labels
    print(words['frontal lobe'])





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    <lisc.data.data.Data object at 0x133d29be0>



.. code-block:: python


    # Iterating through papers found from a particular search term
    #  The iteration returns a dictionary with all the paper data
    for art in words['temporal lobe']:
        print(art['title'])




.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:
