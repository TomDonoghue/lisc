Tutorial 05: Collecting Citation Data
=====================================

Collecting citation data from OpenCitations.


References & Citations
----------------------

Other features of interest about scientific literature are references and citations.

Which articles are cited by a particular article, and how many citations an article
receives can be a useful measure to investigate the literature, and explore
the propogation of ideas.

Unfortunately, citation data has historically been hard to access and investigate, due to
the lack of available databases and APIs that provide access to such information.

OpenCitations Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recently, citation data has become more available with the `OpenCitations <https://opencitations.net>`_
project, which is an initiative to support and provide open bibliographic and citation data.

The OpenCitations project maintains a database of citation data, and provides an API.




.. code-block:: python


    from lisc.collect import collect_citations







OpenCitations API
-----------------

The OpenCitations `API <https://opencitations.net/index/coci/api/v1>`_ offers multiple
utilities to collect citation and reference data.

Articles of interest are specified to the OpenCitations API using
`DOIs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier>`_.

Currently, LISC supports collecting the number of citations and references
for articles from OpenCitations, whereby articles are specified by their DOIs.




.. code-block:: python


    # Set up a list of DOIs to collect data for
    dois = ['10.1007/s00228-017-2226-2', '10.1186/1756-8722-6-59']







Citation Data
-------------

Citations refers to articles that are cited by a specified article.




.. code-block:: python


    # Collect citation data
    citations, meta_data = collect_citations(dois, util='citations')








.. code-block:: python


    # Check out the number of citations per DOI
    for doi, n_cites in citations.items():
        print('{:25s} \t : {}'.format(doi, n_cites))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    10.1007/s00228-017-2226-2        : 3
    10.1186/1756-8722-6-59           : 67


Reference Data
--------------

References refers to articles that are cited by a specified article.




.. code-block:: python


    # Collect reference data
    references, meta_data = collect_citations(dois, util='references')








.. code-block:: python


    # Check out the number of references per DOI
    for doi, n_refs in references.items():
        print('{:25s} \t : {}'.format(doi, n_refs))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    10.1007/s00228-017-2226-2        : 22
    10.1186/1756-8722-6-59           : 53


More Complex Data Collection
----------------------------

Currently the 'collect' functions available in LISC support collecting counts of
references and citations.

The OpenCitations API tools do provide more information, including meta-data on individual
articles that are cited and included in references.

LISC is also very open to contributions. If you are interested in developing
more LISC integration to help collect and analyze more citation related data,
feel free to get involved with the project on `Github <https://github.com/lisc-tools/lisc>`_.
