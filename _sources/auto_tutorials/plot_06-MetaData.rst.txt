Tutorial 06: MetaData
=====================

Exploring the meta data saved during data collections.



.. code-block:: python


    from lisc.utils.db import SCDB
    from lisc.utils.io import load_object







Metadata
--------

Whenever you collect data with LISC, there is some meta data on the
API requests and databases collected.




.. code-block:: python


    # Reload the counts object
    counts = load_object('tutorial_counts', SCDB('lisc_db'))







Metadata Object
---------------

This collection information is collected into a custom MetaData object,

If you are collecting data using the LISC object, such as the `Counts` or `Words`
object, this collection information is attached and saved to the object, as the
`meta_data` attribute.




.. code-block:: python


    # Check the date on which the collection happened
    print(counts.meta_data.date)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    2019-08-15_13:35:41



.. code-block:: python


    # Check the information about the database from which data was collected
    counts.meta_data.db_info







For the next part, we'll reload the `Words` object, which has the same meta data
object available.




.. code-block:: python


    # Reload the words object
    words = load_object('tutorial_words', SCDB('lisc_db'))







Requester MetaData
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The collected meta data also includes information from the Requester object,
which is used to launch URL requests

The Requester object track information including when URL requests were
launched and the number of requests that were made.




.. code-block:: python


    # Check meta data from the requester object
    words.meta_data.requester
